==================

Low-cost industrial Ethernet performance testing

This repository contains documentation and tools in order to conduct performance testing on industrial Ethernet
systems with low-cost components.

NOTICE: Some of the data and tools were created by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
a U.S. government agency.  That data and those tools are available as public domain and are not subject to
any copyright or patents.

This repository contains:

ENIP Background Traffic = EtherNet/IP Interoperability PlugFest Background Traffic.  This is a set of 
broadcast and multicast background traffic that is used during the Interoperability PlugFest events in order
to test a device's ability to survive different amounts of "normal" traffic on an industrial network.
The background traffic is described in both of the following documents:

* Recommended Functionality for EtherNet/IP Devices (Pub 70)
* PlugFest Test Procedure (Pub 95)

These documents change on a regular basis, so check the ODVA EtherNet/IP Library page 
(http://odva.org/Home/ODVATECHNOLOGIES/EtherNetIP/EtherNetIPLibrary.aspx) for the most recent versions.

This repository will be updated with additional information, documentation, and tools as often as possible.
