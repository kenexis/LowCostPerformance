           Industrial Ethernet "Gold Standard" Background Traffic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This set of scripts and network captures were developed by the U.S. National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to simulate different sets of
background traffic to be applied during a series of performance tests for
industrial Ethernet devices.  The type and rate of traffic for each of the
tests is based on those specified in the ODVA EtherNet/IP Interoperability
Test Procedures (PUB00095, available from http://www.odva.org).

The scripts to replay the background traffic are designed for use with
Backtrack Linux (http://www.backtrack-linux.org).  This is a version of Ubuntu
Linux that has been specifically designed for network security testing.
Natively, it includes all of the important tools required to run network
performance testing.  Backtrack is designed to be quiet on a network and not
transmit extraneous network traffic.  Other flavors of Linux can be used for
this testing as well, however the performance capabilities of other versions
has not been verified.  If another version of Linux is used, it must have
tcpreplay installed to transmit the traffic and Wireshark installed to generate
new versions of the traffic files.  You will need to edit the script files to
point to the installed versions of tcpreplay and Wireshark.

The Original_Files directory contains individual network captures for each
protocol inlcuded in the ODVA traffic sets.  These files were all generated by
a commercial packet generator.  It also includes some other files that can be
used to generate new copies of the test capture files.

An analysis of the original capture files and the resulting Backtrack Linux
tcpreplay tests was conducted using a commercial network analyzer.  Testing was
conducted using Backtrack Linux installed on a laptop and also installed on a
persistent USB drive.  A Microsoft Excel workbook contains the results of that
analysis.  The analysis shows that Backtrack Linux is a viable candidate for
conducting this type of testing whether installed directly on a system or loaded
via a USB drive.  The analysis was conducted using the NIST Industrial Ethernet
Network Performance (IENetP) test tool (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ienetp/) and the
NIST Factory Equipment Network Testing (FENT) Framework tool 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/fent/).

If you plan to use a USB drive, it is recommended that you use a "persistent"
install which will allow you to put additional files on the drive, including
these captures and script files.  A "live" USB installation is possible, but
the scripts and capture files will have to be installed on the system each
time a test is conducted or via a second USB drive.  See the Backtrack Linux
website for information on how to create a "persistent" USB installation.
