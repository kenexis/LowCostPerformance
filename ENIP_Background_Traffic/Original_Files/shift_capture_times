# Shift Capture Times
#
# This script shifts the capture times to align properly with the desired
# packet loading values and timing offsets.  There are two EtherNet/IP
# Class 1 I/O capture files created since the initial file is only 43
# seconds in length.  The final versions of the capture files are all
# 60 seconds in length.
#
# The values used to shift the capture files were all determined in the
# Packet_Times.xlsx Excel spreadsheet.  The file times were all normalized
# to a round number to make it easy to determine the first packet offset
# times.
#
# The ARP burst packet capture file was offset by 20 seconds from the base
# capture offset to establish a steady-state condition while conducting
# performance tests before the burst occurs.
